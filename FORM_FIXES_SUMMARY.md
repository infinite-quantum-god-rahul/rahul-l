# üîß Form Fixes Summary

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Removed extra__ prefix from form fields**
- **Problem**: Form fields had `extra__` prefix making them behave differently from normal fields
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated `companies/forms_spec.py` to remove all `extra__` prefixes
  - Updated `companies/views.py` to handle fields without `extra__` prefix
  - Updated all grid templates to remove `extra__` references
  - Fields now behave like normal form fields

### 2. **Fixed mortgage fields showing empty in edit mode**
- **Problem**: Mortgage form fields were not being populated in edit mode
- **Solution**:
  - Updated `companies/forms.py` to add prefill logic in `ExcludeRawCSVDataForm.__init__()`
  - Fixed field types in `forms_spec.py` (changed `mortgage_amount` and `collateral_val` from `char` to `decimal`)
  - Added proper field initialization from `extra_data`

### 3. **Fixed server returning unexpected response when saving**
- **Problem**: Forms were returning 400 Bad Request errors when saving
- **Solution**:
  - Updated `companies/views.py` to handle fields without `extra__` prefix in both create and update operations
  - Added proper field name handling for non-model fields
  - Fixed CSRF trusted origins to include port 8001
